Solved:

May 2019:
#15 - sock-merchant, counting-valleys
#16 - jumping-on-the-clouds, repeated-string, 2d-array, ctci-array-left-rotation
#17 - minimum-swaps-2, new-year-chaos
#20 - crush (array manipulation)

Done with help:
new-year-chaos - did not understand the idea of bribing and that only people in front should be check
crush (array manipulation) - did not find the idea of adding and subtracting value in the array

Done by myself but need attention:
repeated-string - 'modulo' and optimization
minimum-swaps-2 - had idea of sorting at the beginning but moved from it because of simplicity and no possibility to check results
