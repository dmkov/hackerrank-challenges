Solved:

May 2019:
15 - sock-merchant, counting-valleys
16 - jumping-on-the-clouds, repeated-string, 2d-array, ctci-array-left-rotation
17 - minimum-swaps-2, new-year-chaos
20 - crush (array manipulation), ctci-ransom-note
21 - two-strings, sherlock-and-anagrams
22 - ctci-bubble-sort, mark-and-toys, alternating-characters, ctci-making-anagrams

Done with help:
new-year-chaos - did not understand the idea of bribing and that only people in front should be check
crush (array manipulation) - did not find the idea of adding and subtracting value in the array
sherlock-and-anagrams - did not think about the solution with sorting array of substrings. at the end did not understand the adding of total values

Done by myself but need attention:
repeated-string - 'modulo' and optimization
minimum-swaps-2 - had idea of sorting at the beginning but moved from it because of simplicity and no possibility to check results
