 Swap Nodes [Algo]
 https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/swap-nodes-algo/problem

 A binary tree is a tree which is characterized by one of the following properties:
 - It can be empty (null).
 - It contains a root node only.
 - It contains a root node with a left subtree, a right subtree, or both. These subtrees are also binary trees.

 In-order traversal is performed as
 - Traverse the left subtree.
 - Visit root.
 - Traverse the right subtree.

 For this in-order traversal, start from the left child of the root node and keep exploring the left subtree until you reach a leaf. When you reach a leaf, back up to its parent, check for a right child and visit it if there is one. If there is not a child, you've explored its left and right subtrees fully. If there is a right child, traverse its left subtree then its right in the same manner. Keep doing this until you have traversed the entire tree. You will only store the values of a node as you visit when one of the following is true:
 - it is the first node visited, the first time visited
 - it is a leaf, should only be visited once
 - all of its subtrees have been explored, should only be visited once while this is true
 - it is the root of the tree, the first time visited

 Swapping: Swapping subtrees of a node means that if initially node has left subtree L and right subtree R, then after swapping, the left subtree will be R and the right subtree, L.

 For example, in the following tree, we swap children of node 1.

 Depth
   1               1            [1]
  / \             / \
 2   3     ->    3   2          [2]
 \   \           \   \
 4   5           5   4          [3]
 In-order traversal of left tree is 2 4 1 3 5 and of right tree is 3 5 1 2 4.

 Swap operation:
 We define depth of a node as follows:
 - The root node is at depth 1.
 - If the depth of the parent node is d, then the depth of current node will be d+1.
 - Given a tree and an integer, k, in one operation, we need to swap the subtrees of all the nodes at each depth h, where h âˆˆ [k, 2k, 3k,...]. In other words, if h is a multiple of k, swap the left and right subtrees of that level.

 You are given a tree of n nodes where nodes are indexed from [1..n] and it is rooted at 1. You have to perform t swap operations on it, and after each swap operation print the in-order traversal of the current state of the tree.

 Function Description
 Complete the swapNodes function in the editor below. It should return a two-dimensional array where each element is an array of integers representing the node indices of an in-order traversal after a swap operation.
 swapNodes has the following parameter(s):
 - indexes: an array of integers representing index values of each node[i], beginning with node[1], the first element, as the root.
 - queries: an array of integers, each representing a k value.

 Input Format
 The first line contains n, number of nodes in the tree.
 Each of the next n lines contains two integers, a b, where a is the index of left child, and b is the index of right child of ith node.

 Note: -1 is used to represent a null node.

 The next line contains an integer, t, the size of queries.
 Each of the next t lines contains an integer queries[i], each being a value k.

 Output Format
 For each k, perform the swap operation and store the indices of your in-order traversal to your result array. After all swap operations have been performed, return your result array for printing.
